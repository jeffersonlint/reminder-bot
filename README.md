# Remi

## Description

Remi is a simple Reminder bot designed to be used in any Discord server. It is currently being built. This was primarily used as a leaping pad for learning Golang and basic bot setup.

## Usage

You must create a `.env` file in the cloned repository that contains the following:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your discord token>
```

Once that is present, you may now build & run the bot.

```
go build
./reminder-bot
```

You should see output that says `* Bot is now running. Press CTRL+C to exit.` in your terminal window.

Enjoy!

## Notes

This bot was developed using [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file). For questions and concerns, please contact @jeffersonlint on GitHub.
